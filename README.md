SchemaBasedJsonGenerator
========================

Simplistic Schema Based JSON Data Generator.

A quick hack to generate random json data for work load testing. Uses the wonderful DataFactory and LatLng libraries. A Sample schema is provided in the directory src/main/resources. 

Please note that this is a quick hack and requires lots of improvement. Hacked it out since there really is nothing even close to this on the net :-(.

It is fine for using as a base for quick and dirty work. Will be improved in the coming months.
